-- Deferred work lives in Postgres instead of a Redis queue. The old asynq
-- server issued a syncer heartbeat, a worker heartbeat, a delayed-task check
-- and a janitor sweep every few seconds whether or not a single job existed,
-- which is roughly 73k commands a day on an idle instance — more than a
-- 500k commands/month plan allows. The actual job volume is a few messages a
-- day, so a table plus a claim query is the whole queue.
