// Package queue is the platform's Postgres-backed job queue: the work that
// cannot happen inside the request that triggered it, namely a scheduled
// automation send and the delayed marketing-template purge.
//
// It replaces an asynq + Redis queue. Redis was the wrong shape for this app:
// asynq's server syncs, heartbeats, checks for due delayed tasks and sweeps
// expired entries every few seconds whether or not a job exists, which burns
// more commands in a month than the plan allows while the real queue traffic is
// a few messages a day. A row, a claim query and a ticker cost nothing, and a
// queued send now survives a database restart instead of depending on a cache
// that is free to evict it.
